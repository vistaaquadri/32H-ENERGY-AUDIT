Renewable energy policies are limited, and while plans exist to expand electricity access, funding remains a challenge. The state has an active PPP policy and ongoing capacity-building initiatives, with a long-term goal of universal electricity access. Oyo has no budget allocation (score: 0), a weak PPP framework (score: 2), and low FDI (score: 1), limiting investment readiness. Power supply, managed by IBEDC, includes four substations (485.2MW total capacity), but IBEDC receives only 73.56% of its required energy, with low metering coverage (43.16%). 

Based on state stakeholder engagement: A recent audit of the state's electricity infrastructure revealed that Oyo receives between 70 and 80 MW from the national grid, while actual demand exceeds 400 MW, highlighting a signiβicant supply deβicit. The distribution network is reported to have the capacity to deliver 173 MW, meaning only 49% of the state's estimated demand can realistically be supplied through the grid. While the state currently has a 65% metering gap.

Infrastructure expansion includes an 11MW hybrid IPP, a planned 500MW solar project, and the Shell Gas Pipeline Project to improve power supply. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources oversees electricity planning, with plans to establish a dedicated electrification agency. Capacity-building programs focus on renewable energy and grid expansion, but funding and technical expertise remain challenges. Data collection occurs every 4–5 years with limited real-time monitoring, though ongoing digitization efforts place Oyo at a Progressing (3) level in data readiness.",681.49527
