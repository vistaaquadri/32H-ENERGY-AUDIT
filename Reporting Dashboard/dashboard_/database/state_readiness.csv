Budget allocation, PPP engagement, and FDI remain low, reflecting slow progress in energy investment. Transmission capacity meets less than 20% of household demand, with equally low metering rates and grid coverage. The state has 40 MW of commissioned IPP capacity and 3,050 MW planned but no mini-grid data. The state has a dedicated data department but no evidence of a centralized data repository.
